bluetooth - compartamentalize properly; currently will fail to work if home-manager isn't enabled, yet is located in nixosModule. proposed fix: make the part related to homeManager an if-statement. for this, we need to make home-manager an option, but I haven't figured out how to do this 
nvim
emacs
redshift
git credentials
vault secrets
fix section in flake that calls for system modules, where we have the commented line "stringListToEnabledOptions env.nixosVars.modules.ToEnable"
copy/pasting from nvim
get aliases working
automatically load openai api key
